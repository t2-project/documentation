=====================

The T2 store consists of seven services:

*  UI : The application frontend. 
*  UIBackend : API Gateway.
*  Cart : Manages user's shopping carts.
*  Orchestrator : Orchestrates the saga.
   It uses the eventuate tram framework.
   Each saga instance is persisted to a database. 
   To achieve the required at-least-once delivery,
   communication with the saga participants happens via a message broker.
*  Order : Persists orders to a database and marks them either as success or as failure.
*  Payment : Handles the storeâ€™s payment by contacting an external credit institutes.
*  Inventory: Manages the store's products. 

All components, except for the UI and its back end, who have no database at all, have their own databases.
The communication is either over HTTP or messaging. The UI and its back end communicate with HTTP calls.
All participants of the saga as well as the orchestrator communicate among each other with messages. 


The T2 store realises the following business process:
