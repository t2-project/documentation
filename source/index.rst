Introduction
============

The T2 Store is a micro-service reference application that implements the Saga pattern.
It is loosely based on the `TeaStore Application <https://github.com/DescartesResearch/TeaStore>`__.

The T2 Store consists of seven services that realise the storeâ€™s business logic plus two additional services, one to simulate an external payment provider, as an example some credit institute and the other to test the store at runtime. 

All services are Spring Boot Applications. 
They are instrumented with `Prometheus <https://prometheus.io/>`__ for metrics and with `Jaeger <https://www.jaegertracing.io/>`__  for tracing.

See the :ref:`architecture overview <arch>` for more information about the architecture.
See the :ref:`howtos  <use>` and :ref:`howtos  <deploy>` for more information about how to use the store.


.. Requirements
.. ------------

.. The T2 Store is developed as a reference application.
