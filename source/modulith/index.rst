T2-Modulith
===================

The T2-Modulith is an implementation of the :ref:`T2-Project microservices variant <microservices>` as a modular monolith.
It has still a modular structure enforced by `Spring Modulith <https://spring.io/projects/spring-modulith>`_. Therefore we name it *T2-Modulith*.

The T2-Modulith is a Spring Boot application.

See page :doc:`Architecture <arch>` for more information about the monolithic architecture.
See pages :doc:`Usage <use>` and :doc:`Deployment <deploy>` for more information about how to use the T2-Modulith.
